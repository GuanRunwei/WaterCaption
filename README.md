# WaterCaption: A Fine-Grained Image Captioning Dataset for Inland Waterways

## 📘 Overview

**WaterCaption** is a large-scale, fine-grained image captioning dataset specifically designed for **inland waterway scenes** based on **Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs)**. WaterCaption, the first captioning dataset specifically designed for waterway environments. WaterCaption focuses on fine-grained, multi-region long-text descriptions, providing a new research direction for visual geo-understanding and spatial scene cognition. Exactly, it includes 20.2k image-text pair data with 1.8 million vocabulary size.
